> * Python study guide 

This is my collection of Python learning materials organized as Jupyter notebooks. Think of it as a structured roadmap that takes you from "What's a variable?" all the way to cracking coding interviews. Everything's arranged in order, so you can just follow along step-by-step.

## The Learning Path (Follow This Order!)

Here's how I've organized everything - just go through these files one by one:

### **Phase 1: Getting Started**
📝 **00-Topic-in-Python.**  
*Start here!* Quick intro to Python, how notebooks work, and what we're going to learn.

📝 **01-Basics**  
Variables, data types, printing stuff, getting user input - the absolute fundamentals.

📝 **02-Control-Statements**  
If/else conditions, loops (for & while), list comprehensions - basically how to control program flow.

### **Phase 2: Building Blocks**
📝 **03-Functions**  
Writing reusable code, understanding arguments, return values, scope, and those mysterious lambda functions.

📝 **04-OOPs**  
Classes, objects, inheritance - how to think in objects and organize your code properly.

### **Phase 3: Going Deeper**
📝 **05-Advanced-Concepts**  
Modules, decorators, generators, context managers - the cool stuff that makes Python powerful.

📝 **06-CMD-and-Scripting**  
Running Python from terminal, command-line arguments, making actual scripts people can use.

### **Phase 4: Problem Solving**
📝 **07-DSA**  
Data structures & algorithms - arrays, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, searching, Big O notation.

📝 **08-Important-Programs**  
Practice problems you NEED to know - patterns, common challenges, muscle-memory building.

📄 **Python-Interview.pdf**  
Interview prep cheatsheet - questions you'll actually get asked, with answers.
